##Rage.reduce() is a mental health application that stops you from making bad social decisions and gets you on the path to make better ones. 

In today's online world, it is ever so important to have a respectable online presence. We've all heard of those people. Even though they seem to be good people, they make horrible decisions on the internet, saying things that just rub people the wrong way. This is prevalent on all types of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and others. 

###For some reason, the "anonymity" of the internet tends to lead people into saying  offensive comments that they might not otherwise! 

###Let's fix that.

We could all use a bro. The bro that holds us back when we go too far. The bro who stays behind, ever caring and ever watching, to make sure that you're doing all right on the internet. 



Using machine learning techniques that leverage sentiment analysis, string token aggregation, and crowd funded statement definitions, we take the negative statements that you might say and turn them into what you really mean. And if we can't, we'll stop you and give you a chance to think again about what you really want to say. 

The result is amazing. You don't have to be afraid to hold back anymore. You have the freedom to be yourself anywhere you go and when you go too far, Rage.reduce() will be on your side.
