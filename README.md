##Rage.reduce() is a mental health application that stops you from making bad social decisions and gets you on the path to make better ones. 

In today's online world, it is ever so important to have a respectable online presence. We've all heard of those people. Even though they seem to be well mannered in real life, they tend to make horrible decisions on the internet, saying things that rub others the wrong way. This is prevalent on all forms of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr. 

###The illusion of anonymity on the internet tends to lead people into saying some really hurtful or stupid comments that can ruin their reputation.

###Let's fix that.

Using machine learning techniques that leverage sentiment analysis, string token aggregation, and crowd funded definitions, we take the negative statements that you might say and turn them into positive ones. And if we can't, we'll stop you and give you a chance to think about what you really want to say. 

The result is amazing. You don't have to be afraid to hold back anymore. You'll have the freedom to be yourself anywhere you go and when you go too far, Rage.reduce() will be at your side.
